  <h1>Keyboarding</h1>
  <a href="actualindex.html">Back...</a>
  <h3>A Brief History</h3>
  <p>Keyboards are derived from the the mechanical typewriter. Each "key" on a typewriter was a button pressed to stamp ink onto
  a sheet of paper in the spool, aligned carefully to prepare documents. It eliminated the need for writing, was much faster,
  and made a universal standard.<br>
  Keyboards have nearly replaced the typewriter, being lighter and not needing ink. It was implemented into computers ..
  
  <h3>An Overview</h3>
  <p>Most keyboards follow the QWERTY format, with these alphabetical characters arranged in the top left. It was chosen to accomodate
  the letters most used in the English language, while being spread out and preventing jams in typewriters, where the keys pressed would
  lock with the surrounding ones.</p>
  
  Others include DVORAK, Colemak, or language specific variants, like AZERTY.
  
  <p>Keys on the left side (used by the left hand) of the keyboard can form more words than on the right (lollipop being the longest).</p>
  
  <p>The number keys, F1-F12 keys, and symbol keys all have 2 characters on one key, (wiki def for this). The lower character is the default,
  displayed by pressed it. The upper character is a ___modifier? character, requiring use of the left or right SHIFT key in combination with
  the key to display the upper character. SHIFT is not the only combination key that can be used with others. CTRL, or control key is another
  as well as ALT, ESC, WIN/OPTION/?? and any of the F keys.
  
  Common 'shortcuts' (good to remember):
  <br>CTRL - Z(Undo n Previous actions - n is the number of times Ctrl-Z is pressed)<br>
  CTRL - C (Copies selected content)<br>
  CTRL - V (Pastes selected content)<br>
  CTRL - Y (Redo an undone/previous action - opposite of Ctrl Z)<br>
  CTRL - A (Select All content) <br>
  <br>
  CTRL - P (Print to document/file)<br>
  CTRL - F (Find containing text in document)<br>
  CTRL - W (Close Window)<br>
  CTRL - S (Save changes)<br>
  CTRL - R (Reload or refresh)<br>
  CTRL - X (Cut selected content)<br>
  
  CTRL - ALT - DEL (Break or interrupt process)<br>
  ALT - LEFT (Previous page)<br>
