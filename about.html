	<h1>About This Place</h1>
	You've reached the...Weird...Wide Web.
	<a href="actualindex.html">Back...</a>
	<p>We hope to make the Web understandable to everyone. Whether you're part of a business, organization, or an average user, here you can be empowered.</p>

<p><em>Why weird?</em> Good question. Every person has some "weirdness", and it's reflected in certain areas of the web. We take interest and admire it--a strangely wonderful quality.</p>
<p>This lets us range far on the Web, beyond larger Websites. In unexpected places, we can find incredible things.</p>
	
	<p>"An 'Inter-dex', simply put."</p>
