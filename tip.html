  <p>Everyone is free to post information online. But just as in reality, not everything said or posted can be true; some information posted online can be influenced
  by bias or affiliation.</p>
  
  <p>With increasing contradictory information, it can be difficult to see what can be trusted online.<br>
  
  Reliable sources often have these features:
  Neutral tone and language, not charged
  Logical arguments to back up their stance
  .gov or .org websites
  
  
  
  
  </p>
  <p>However, beliefs of others are different. If a belief or opinion they have does not align with yours, they are not wrong for having that opinion/belief, as it is more personal than informative.</p>
